# Infrastructure as Code (IAC) - [link to article](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/resources/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)

## Concept
- Is a mainstream pattern for managing infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface or through manual command line script sequence
- Transition from physical hardware ( data center) to pay-per-use cloud infrastructure.
- Importance of using only necessary infrastructure due to cost efficiency.
- Need for elasticity in infrastructure usage.

## Challenges Without IAC
- Manual management of infrastructure is time-consuming and error-prone.
- Filing numerous tickets to manage infrastructure changes is impractical.

## Benefits of IAC
- Automates infrastructure management, reducing human error.
- Codifies infrastructure processes, enabling repeatability and scalability.
- Scripts can automate scaling up and down of infrastructure as needed.

## Advantages of Codification
- Infrastructure definitions can be checked into version control.
- Provides versioning and incremental history of changes.
- Enhances transparency and documentation of infrastructure configurations.
- Moves away from traditional, undocumented point-and-click setups.

## Overall Value of IAC
- Versioning and reusability of code.
- Enables automation and efficient management of infrastructure.
